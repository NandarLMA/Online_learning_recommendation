## Project Description

In today's digital era, online learning platforms have become an integral part of education, offering a plethora of courses to cater to diverse learning needs. This project aims to develop a robust and personalized Online Learning Course Recommendation System utilizing the Coursera dataset. Coursera is a widely recognized online learning platform that provides a rich source of data on courses, user preferences, and other relevant information.

**Project Overview:**

The aim of this project is to develop a personalized online learning course recommendation system, leveraging a scikit-learn regression model, based on user-input preferences. The system will take into account the minimum number of enrolled students, course difficulty level, course duration, and course rating to recommend the most suitable top 5 courses for each user.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Input:**
   - Minimum number of enrolled students.
   - Course difficulty level.
   - Course duration.
   - Course rating.

2. **Recommendation Model:**
   - Utilize scikit-learn regression model to predict the top 5 courses based on user preferences.
   - Consider features such as enrolled students, difficulty level, duration, and rating for accurate predictions.

3. **Prediction Visualizations:**
   - **Bar Chart - Enrolled Student vs Course:**
     Display a bar chart illustrating the predicted number of enrolled students for the recommended courses.
   - **Plot - Overall Rating vs Course:**
     Generate a plot showcasing the predicted overall rating for each recommended course.

4. **Dataset Visualizations:**
   - **Count Plots:**
     Visualize dataset insights through count plots for the following features:
     - Course Rating
     - Course Certificate Type
     - Course Difficulty Level
     - Course Time

**Expected Outcomes:**
1. A functional and interactive Online Learning Course Recommendation System.
2. Personalized top 5 course recommendations based on user preferences.
3. Visualizations showcasing predicted enrolled students and overall rating for recommended courses.
4. Informative count plots providing insights into various dataset features.
